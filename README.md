## Gitflow
This repository has one primary branch, `master`. All changes from henceforth will be pull requests to merge into master. All pull requests should be a single commit, of the same name as the branch name. Pull request branch names should be of the form `type/task-completed`, e.g. `chore/created-readme` or `feature/user-auth`. The following types ought to be used (this is subject to change):
* `feature`
* `chore`
* `bug`
